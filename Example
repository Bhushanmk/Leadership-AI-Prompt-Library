### TASK
Create a **leadership-ready cost vs value justification** for an initiative or investment.

### CONTEXT
- Audience: Executives, Finance, Clients
- Goal: Support funding or approval decisions
- Style: Business-first, risk-aware

### RULES
1. Frame value in outcomes, not features
2. Include cost of inaction
3. Avoid over-promising ROI
4. Keep it concise and balanced

### CLARIFICATION RULE
Ask before proceeding if unclear:
- Approval context (budget / headcount / vendor)
- Time horizon (quarter / annual)
- Financial sensitivity

### INPUT
Initiative / Ask:
Introduce a Provision Preview capability that allows users to generate
and review provision text before the CCR cycle. The goal is to reduce CCR
errors, rework, and late-stage corrections.

Estimated Cost:
- Development: 2–3 sprints (API orchestration, rule execution, UI changes)
- Infrastructure: Minimal (reuse existing services)
- Ongoing Ops: Low to moderate (monitoring, support)

Expected Benefits:
- Reduced CCR rework
- Fewer production defects
- Faster CCR turnaround
- Improved provision accuracy

### DIAGRAM REQUIREMENT
Include a **Cost vs Value visual** such as:
- Cost stack vs benefit outcomes
- Timeline showing investment vs payoff
- Risk exposure if delayed

Keep it executive-friendly.

### FORMAT
## Executive Summary
## Cost Overview
## Value & Benefits
## Risks of Not Investing
## Recommendation

### SELF-REVIEW CHECK
- Is value clearly articulated?
- Are risks credible?
- Would this help leadership decide quickly?
