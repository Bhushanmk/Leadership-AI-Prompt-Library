### TASK
Identify the **most likely questions leadership will ask** about a proposal,
architecture, or initiative so the presenter can prepare clear responses.

### CONTEXT
- Audience: Executives, Directors, Client leadership
- Goal: Anticipate concerns and expectations before reviews or approvals
- Focus areas: Delivery, risk, cost, value, ownership

### RULES
1. Think like a skeptical but reasonable leader
2. Focus on outcomes, risk, and decision clarity
3. Avoid deep technical or implementation-level questions
4. Group questions by theme
5. For each question, explain:
   - Why leadership asks it
   - What they expect to hear in the answer

### CLARIFICATION RULE
Ask before proceeding if unclear:
- Audience type (internal / client)
- Purpose (approval / review / escalation)

### INPUT
Proposal / Architecture / Initiative Summary:
We are introducing a Provision Preview capability that allows users to
generate and review provision text before the CCR cycle. The UI triggers
a synchronous call to a Provision Preview API, which aggregates data from
Product, Benefit, and Pricing services, applies business rules, and
returns preview text to the UI. The goal is to reduce CCR errors and
rework
