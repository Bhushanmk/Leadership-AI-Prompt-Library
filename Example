## Architecture Overview (As Understood)
The UI initiates a synchronous request to a Provision Preview API, which
aggregates data from multiple downstream services, applies rules, and
returns generated provision text for user review before CCR execution.

## Strengths
- Clear separation between UI and backend processing
- Reuse of existing Product, Benefit, and Pricing services
- Early validation improves downstream CCR accuracy

## Risks & Gaps

| Area | Observation | Risk Level | Notes |
|-----|------------|-----------|------|
| Performance | Multiple synchronous downstream calls | High | Risk of slow UI response |
| Scalability | No async or caching strategy | Medium | Load spikes may degrade system |
| Reliability | No retry or fallback mechanism | High | Single service failure breaks flow |
| Data Consistency | Temporary preview storage not versioned | Medium | Risk of stale preview data |
| Operability | No logging or monitoring mentioned | Medium | Hard to debug production issues |

## Key Assumptions
- Downstream services can handle preview load
- Preview generation time is acceptable for UI users
- Preview data does not need audit persistence

## Recommendations
### Immediate (Before Build)
- Introduce async rule execution or background processing
- Add timeout, retry, and circuit breaker patterns
- Cache frequently accessed configuration data

### Near-Term (Post MVP)
- Add audit trail for preview generations
- Introduce monitoring and performance metrics
- Consider bulk preview generation for large products
